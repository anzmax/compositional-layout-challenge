# Compositional Layout Challenge

This project is my tutorial on using the compositional layout in UICollectionView to create complex and flexible layouts in iOS apps. It utilizes mock requests to simulate data fetching and demonstrates the dynamic construction of collection views based on varying data types and structures.

## Features

- **Compositional Layouts**: Utilizes the powerful compositional layout system of UICollectionView to create advanced layouts.
- **Mock Requests**: Incorporates mock data requests to simulate network data fetching.
- **Dynamic Collection Views**: Shows how to dynamically build collection views with different sections and item types.
